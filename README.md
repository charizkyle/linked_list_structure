# 🍣 Linked List Structure – How to Make a Sushi

This project demonstrates a **Linked List implementation** and with methods to remove nodes from the **beginning**, **end**, or a **specific step** in the process.

## 🧠 Features
- `append(data)` – Add a new step to the end of the list  
- `display()` – Show all steps in the linked list  
- `remove_beginning()` – Remove the first step and return its value  
- `remove_at_end()` – Remove the last step and return its value  
- `remove_at(data)` – Remove a specific step by name (user input)

## 🧩 Example Flow

---

```
HOW TO MAKE A SUSHI 🍣 (LINKED LIST):

prepare -> cook rice -> slice ingredients -> roll sushi -> serve -> X
```
```
REMOVED AT BEGINNING ('prepare'):

cook rice -> slice ingredients -> roll sushi -> serve -> X
```
```
REMOVED AT END ('serve'):

cook rice -> slice ingredients -> roll sushi -> X
```
```
REMOVED AT ('slice ingredients'):

cook rice -> roll sushi -> X
```

```
If the user enters a step that doesn’t exist, the program prints: X
```
