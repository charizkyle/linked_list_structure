This Python program demonstrates a basic implementation of a **Singly Linked List** data structure.

It includes core operations such as:

- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Delete a specific node by value
- Display the current state of the list

The linked list is used here to represent a sequence of sushi-making steps:

```
assemble → prepare → roll → X
```

Each operation updates the list and prints the result to show how the structure changes after deletion or insertion.
